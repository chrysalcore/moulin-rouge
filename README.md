## Description

**Moulin Rouge Front-end** was created to provide a template website for the legendary Moulin Rouge restaurant.

The site has three pages with several sections, displaying a menu full of categories, events, business information and contact details. It showcases an incredible contrast in its carefully chosen color palette, elegant and warm typography, and images that create a unique atmosphere—all with the aim of transporting the user to that wonderful dinner they should already book!

The codebase is written in **React + TypeScript**, with state management using **strongly-typed contexts, reducers and custom hooks**. Data is retrieved from a third-party API through a typed helper layer. It also adheres to best practices, responsiveness, accessibility, and other modern web standards.

## Main Features

- Advanced state management with **context**, **reducers**.
- Strong typing across **components**, **hooks**, **context**, **router** and **helpers** using TypeScript.
- API consumption: efficient connection with RESTful APIs for read operations, with typed responses.
- Componentization with React + TypeScript.
- Responsive UI/UX: Interface designed with CSS that adapts to all devices.
- Cyclic animations, Smooth scrolling and a fluid user experience.
